## Section One: Introduction to Markdown.
This section introduces the basic syntax of Markdown language, which is a lightweight markup language that allows you to create formatted text files without needing a full-fledged word processor.
Markdown is very helpful in writing of texts.
It's a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax that focuses on readability rather than on looks.
## Section Two: Basic Syntax
Here are some basic elements of the Markdown syntax:
- Headers (Headers can be from H1 (biggest) to H6.)
- Combine two things or Headings in one special block,just give > greater then mark between the line one empty line.
- like:
>heading 1
>
>heading 2
## Section Three:Line break
For breaking the line use double Enter key.
If you are writing some thing like this:

I am ***Ambreen***.

Doing work on **Markdown**.
This is very easy and intrusting learning with ***Dr. Muhammad Amaar Tufail*** and ***Dr.Kashif Hussain Talpur***. 
## Face of Text:
Bold text use double star **

Italic text use single star *

Bold and Italic use triple star ***

or you can use (underscore) symbole, for Bold use double underscore both sides of text.like:__Bold__,
for Italic use single underscore both sides of text.like:_Italic_,
for Bold and Italic use triple underscore both sides of text.like:___Bold and Italic___.
## Bullet Points/ Lists:
Use dash or subtract symbole like:
- Markdown
- In 75 minutes
- With M. Amaar Tufail
    - ___Mentor___ of __Python ka Chilla__
    - In 40 Days
# Hyperlinks Or Links:
For hyperlinks you have to write linke in between the <> greater and less then symbole, like:

<https://codanics.com/courses/?keyword=&tutor-course-filter-category=43&course_filter=true&loop_content_only=false&column_per_row=3&course_per_page=12&show_pagination=false&current_page=1&action=tutor_course_filter_ajax>

For Links you have to write the name of link in between large brackets [],and then write the adress of that link in between the prentheses(), like:

[Codanics.com/courses](https://codanics.com/courses/)

### This is the way you can put your links from internet with just copy and paste..
### Or you don't want to write the like or don't want show the link in your book, then give any name to your link and write the word next (here), for example
[Python]:https://codanics.com/courses/

The complete course is [here][Python].

# Images and Figures links:
Online Picture (ye abhi complete nai he.)


![alt text](lady2-1.jpg)
> alt text ye markdown ne khud is picture co apna name deya he..
>

# **Adding Code Or Code Block:**
You can add code by using back tick ` on either side of your code.

This is called code..

>python
To print a string use backtick.

 `print("Python ka Chilla.")`

>This is strings. Block of Code..
```
python
print("I am Ambreen.
And learning Python with** Dr. Muhammad Amaar Tufail** and **Dr. Kashif Hussain Talpur**.
Muhammad Amaar  has Youtube Channel **'Codanics'**.
Right now I am working on **Markdown**.
This is my first Markdown Book.")
```
>This is operator..
```
python
x= 83+38-22
y= 55*45-4
z= 45/5*(43-23)
print(z)
print(x)
print(y)
```
# Adding Tables:
**Marksheet of tuition students**
|student name| class| grades| age|
| :-------:| :-----:|:------:| :-------:|
| Abdullah| v| A| 10|
|Abdulsattar| VI| A+|11|
| Basit|V| C|10.5|
|Bushra| VI|B|11.4|
|Faiza|V|B|10.6|\

So this is the way to make table..
